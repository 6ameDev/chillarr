# ChillArr
ChillArr is a project aimed at making it blazing fast to setup a Servarr application suite based mediacenter running on Docker.

Featured applications:
- [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/) is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.
- [Radarr](https://radarr.video/) is a movie collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new movies and will interface with clients and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of existing files in the library when a better quality format becomes available.
- [Lidarr](https://lidarr.audio/) is a music collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new tracks from your favorite artists and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.
- [Readarr](https://readarr.com/) is an eBook and audiobook collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new books and will interface with clients and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them.
